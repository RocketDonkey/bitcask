# Bitcask

A very simple / incomplete / not good implementation of a
[Bitcask](https://riak.com/assets/bitcask-intro.pdf). The paper was
interesting, so figured it'd be fun to try implementing it. This is lacking all
kinds of features and has some rough edges, but should be good enough to post
to GitHub and never look at again.
